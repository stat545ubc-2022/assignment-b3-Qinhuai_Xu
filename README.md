## My choice of assignment
Option A - BC Liquor app

## Description
I added 5 features to BC Liquor shiny app:
1. Use the DT package to turn the static table into an interactive table
2. Show the number of results found whenever the filters change
3. Allow the user to download the BC Liquor table as a .csv file
4. Allow the user to search for multiple types simultaneously
5. Use tabsetPanel to place plot and table in separate tabs

## Data source
