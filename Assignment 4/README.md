## My choice of assignment 4
Option C â€“ Shiny App, and I would like to build onto my assignment 3 shiny app - BC Liquor Store Data

## Description
In assignment B-3 I have added 5 features:
1. Feature 1: Use the DT package to turn the static table into an interactive table
2. Feature 2: Show the number of results found whenever the filters change
3. Feature 3: Allow the user to download the BC Liquor table as a .csv file
4. Feature 4: Allow the user to search for multiple types simultaneously
5. Feature 5: Use tabsetPanel to place plot and table in separate tabs


In assignment B-4, I added another 3 features to my BC Liquor shiny app :
1. Feature 6: Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI
2. Feature 7: Add country filter to allow the users to search for multiple countries simultaneously
3. Feature 8: Add CSS to make the app look nicer.
