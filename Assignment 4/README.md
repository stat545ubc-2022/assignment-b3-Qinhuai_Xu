## My choice of assignment 4
Option C â€“ Shiny App 
And I would like to build onto my assignment 3 shiny app - BC Liquor Store Data


## Description
I added 3 more features to BC Liquor shiny app in assignment B-4:
1. Feature 6: Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI
2. Feature 7: Add country filter to allow the users to search for multiple countries simultaneously
3. Feature 8: Add CSS to make the app look nicer.
